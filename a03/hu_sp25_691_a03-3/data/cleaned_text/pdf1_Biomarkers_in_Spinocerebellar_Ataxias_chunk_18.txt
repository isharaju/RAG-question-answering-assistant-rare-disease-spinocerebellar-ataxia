variabil - for developing a disease or a medical condition are of minor ity that may indicate the risk of falls [ 52, 53 ]. cag repeat significance in scas, as the disease risk is determined by length is not only associated with the age at ataxia onset, but the gene mutation. conversion to manifest ataxia can be also ataxia progression. however, the association is weak considered as a medical condition. biomarkers that have the which limits the value of repeat length as predictor of pro - potential to predict the risk and time of conversion have been gression. recent work in sca1 and sca3 suggested the discussed above in the context of prognostic biomarkers. mri volume measures and mrs metabolites were associated with faster ataxia progression [ 14, 22 ]. to make further progress in validation of prognostic biomarkers for scas, there is an obvious need for longitudinal studies, both in patients and pre - ataxic mutation carriers. 1 3 104 page 8 of 11 the cerebellum ( 2025 ) 24 : 104 2. fda - nih biomarker working group. best ( biomarkers, endconclusions points, and other tools ) resource ; 2021. 3. califf rm. biomarker definitions and their applications. exp biol development and validation of biomarkers for scas are med ( maywood ). 2018 ; 243 : 213 – 21. https : / / doi. org / 1 0. 1 1 7 7 / 1 5 3 5 3 7 0 2 1 7 7 5 0 0 8 8. rapidly evolving. nevertheless, only few biomarkers are 4. klockgether t, mariotti c, paulson hl. spinocerebellar ataxia. firmly established for scas. while there is growing evinat rev dis primers. 2019 ; 5 : 24. dence for mri volume measures as biomarkers to moni - 5. pellerin d, danzi mc, wilke c, renaud m, fazal s, dicaire m - j, tor progression, there is still a lack of data on sufficiently et al. deep intronic fgf14 gaa repeat expansion in late - onset cerebellar ataxia. n engl j med. 2023 ; 388 : 128 – 41. https : / / doi. or validatedprognosticandresponsebiomarkersforscas. g /
