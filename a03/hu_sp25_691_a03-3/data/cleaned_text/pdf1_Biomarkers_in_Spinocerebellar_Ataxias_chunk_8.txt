3 104 page 4 of 11 the cerebellum ( 2025 ) 24 : 104 predictor of ataxia progression in sca1 and sca3 [ 14, 22 ]. imaging biomarkers an overview of nfl studies in scas is given table 2. there are numerous cross - sectional studies reporting scas are characterized by progressive brain and spinal abnormalities of biochemical markers in scas. some of cord tissue loss that can be studied by structural magnetic the markers were shown to be abnormal already in the pre - resonance imaging ( mri ). mri metrics that appropriately ataxic stage, for others, correlations with disease duration reflect tissue loss include brain regional volumes and spinal and clinical scores were shown. although some of them cord cross - sectional areas. several studies in polyglutamine hold promise for further development, none of them has yet scas consistently found that volumes of the cerebellum, taken the necessary validation steps to be seriously consid - brainstem, or basal ganglia decreased over time with effect ered as biomarkers in the strict sense defined above [ 1, 2 ]. sizes exceeding that of sara [ 14, 22, 43 â€“ 46 ]. in conin particular, there is a complete lack of longitudinal studies trast, spinal cord cross - sectional areas did not significantly of these markers. decrease in sca1 and sca3 [ 45, 46 ]. pons volume had the concentrations of csf glial fibrillary acidic protein highest responsiveness of all volumes in sca1 [ 14, 43, 44 ], ( gfap ), an astrocytic marker, were increased in sca1, sca3 [ 22 ], and sca7 patients [ 44 ], and sca3 pre - ataxic whereas blood concentrations were not elevated in sca1, mutation carriers [ 22 ]. in sca2 patients, cerebellum and sca2, and sca3 [ 14, 26, 27 ]. plasma ubiquitin carboxy - brainstem [ 44, 47 ], in sca2 pre - ataxic mutation carriers terminal hydrolase l1 ( uchl1 ), a neuronal protein had the highest responsiveness [ 47 ]. in sca1, pons and cerinvolved in proteasomal degradation, was not increased ebellar volume, in sca3, medulla oblongata were predicin sca3 [ 27 ]. total tau was increased in a subgroup of
