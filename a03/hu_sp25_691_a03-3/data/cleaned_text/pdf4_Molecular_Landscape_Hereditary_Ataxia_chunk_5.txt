we describe the molecular na1a ( sca6 ), atxn7 ( sca7 ), ppp2r2b ( sca12 ) and characterization of a consecutive single - center series of 70 atn1 ( drpla ) ; cag / tag repeats in atxn8 ( sca8 ) ; patients with genetically uncharacterized ha assessed with [ ( cag ) ( caa ) ( cag ) caa cag caa ( cag ) caa 3 3 x y a two - step workflow leveraging on the analysis of repeat cag ] repeats in tbp ( sca17 ) ; attct repeats in atxn10 expansions as first tier followed by wes. ( sca10 ) ; ggcctg repeats in nop56 ( sca36 ) ; gaa repeats fxn ( frda ). sca1 / 2 / 3 / 6 / 7 analysis was performed with the ce - ivd marked scas kit - fl ( experteam materials and methods s. r. l. ) while sca8 / 10 / 12 / 17 / 36, drpla and frda analysis was performed with a custom - based method ( validated patient and sample collection in house ). a primer labeled at 5 ’ with a fluorescent molecule located upstream of the repeated sequence and a chimeric this study uses clinical information and biological samples reverse primer partially overlapping the repeated region from 70 individuals referred to the medical genetics insti - were created. custom primers and thermocycler conditions tute of the azienda sanitaria universitaria friuli centrale are available upon request. after amplification, pcr prod ( asufc ) of udine, italy, from 2006 to 2024. informed ucts were denatured, and fragment analysis was performed written consent for research was obtained from all patients on a 3500xl genetic analyzer ( thermo fischer scientific ). for use of their samples in genetic studies. this study was amplicon length of separated fragments was calculated approved by the institutional review board ( rif. prot irb - relatively using gs500 - liz molecular weight standard dmed : 294 / 2024 ). by the genemapper software ( thermo fischer scientific ). after obtaining the peak pattern, number of repeats was calculated. 1 3 human genetics ( 2025 ) 144 : 545 – 557 547 whole ex
