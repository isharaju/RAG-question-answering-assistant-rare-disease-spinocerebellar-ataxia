of 11 the cerebellum ( 2025 ) 24 : 104 table 1 biomarker categories according to best ( biomarkers, endpoints, and other tools ) resource [ 2 ] biomarker category definition diagnostic biomarker used to detect or confirm presence of a disease or condition of interest or to identify individuals with a subtype of the disease monitoring biomarker measured repeatedly for assessing status of a disease or medical condition or for evidence of exposure to ( or effect of ) a medical product or an environmental agent predictive biomarker used to identify individuals who are more likely than similar individuals without the biomarker to experience a favourable or unfavourable effect from exposure to a medical product or an environmental agent prognostic biomarker used to identify likelihood of a clinical event, disease recurrence or progression in patients who have the disease or medical condition of interest response biomarker used to show that a biological response, potentially beneficial or harmful, has occurred in an individual who has been exposed to a medical product or an environmental agent subcategory pharmacodynamic biomarker : biomarker that indicates biologic activity of a medical product or environmental agent subcategory surrogate endpoint biomarker : biomarker that is an endpoint used in clinical trials as a substitute for a direct measure of how a patient feels, functions, or survive safety biomarker measured before or after an exposure to a medical product or an environmental agent to indicate the likelihood, presence, or extent of toxicity as an adverse effect susceptibility / risk biomarker that indicates the potential for developing a disease or medical condition in an individual who does not currently have clinically apparent disease or the medical condition f ig. 1 clinical validation of biomarkers. biomarker candidates are shown in the top row. clinical studies are needed for their validation. the different types of studies, which serve to obtain the clinical validation data, are shown in the middle row. the bottom row gives the different types of biomarkers. the connecting lines indicate, which studies are needed for the clinical validation of the various markers processes, which finally lead to ataxia [ 4 ]. biomarkers can be measured ( analytical validation ), and that it has the abilthus be classified by the pathophysiological event that they ity to predict or measure the relevant clinical concept ( clinireflect. they are also classified according to their intended cal validation ) [ 2 ]. depending on the type
