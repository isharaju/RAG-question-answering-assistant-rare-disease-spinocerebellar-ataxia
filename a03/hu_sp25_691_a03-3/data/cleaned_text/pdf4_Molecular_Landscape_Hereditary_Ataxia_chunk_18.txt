gfap associthe latter known to reduce galc activity by average ated with alexander disease ( alxdrd, mim # 203450 ) ; 10 â€“ 50 % ( shin et al. 2016 ). our proband harbored an intra - and a heterozygous variant in col4a1 associated with genic ~ 30 - kb galc deletion and the known p. arg184cys microangiopathy and leukoencephalopathy pontine ( padand p. ile562thr disease - associated functional polymor - mal, mim # 618564 ). gfap variants affecting the p. arg88 phisms. the deletion, spanning from exons 11 to 17, is a codon have been already highlighted in patients affected by common founder variant in the european population and juvenile and adult - onset alxdrd, showing bulbar signs, correlates with a loss of the entirety of the smaller 30 - kda ataxia and spasticity as pivotal clinical symptoms ( heshsubunit and part of the larger 50 - to 52 - kda subunit of the matzad et al. 2022 ; grossi et al. 2024 ). notwithstanding, all galc protein, resulting in a loss of function ( heller et al. disorders present abnormal gait / spasticity / ataxia and the age 2023 ). both the p. arg184cys and the p. ile562thr variants, of onset is variable among affected patients. ( romano et al. together with the p. asp248asn variant, are associated with 2024 ; qi et al. 2024 ). our patient refused to undergo mri reduced amount and activity of the mature galc pro - with contrast medium, so the imaging data obtained so far tein, approximating a hypomorphic variant ( iacono et al. are not conclusive. indeed, in patients with adrenomyelo2022 ). indeed, in vitro analysis highlighted how the com - neuropathy, mri of the spinal cord without contrast shows bination of the p. ile562thr with a pathogenic variant ( i. e., nonspecific atrophy, whereas abnormalities are evident with p. tyr567ser or p. gly286asp ) substantially reduced galc gadolinium uptake. electromyography,
