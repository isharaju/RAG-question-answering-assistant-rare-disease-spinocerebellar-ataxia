[ 10 ]. based on data of two large european sca nfl plasma levels modestly increased in a 1 - year followcohorts, regression models that predict the age of onset in up study of 34 sca1 patients [ 14 ]. modelling of longitudisca1, sca2, sca3, and sca6 were developed. apart nal nfl data of a large european cohort of sca3 mutation from the length of the expanded allele, these models also carriers, showed a steady increase throughout the disease take into account the actual age and – depending on the sca course with an onset of abnormality of 21. 5 years before subtype – the length of the normal allele [ 11 ]. in a large clinical manifestation [ 22 ]. in both studies, responsiveness cohort of chinese sca3 patients, a logistic survival model of nfl was lower than that of the standard clinical outusing repeat length and actual age as inputs provided the come, the scale for the assessment and rating of ataxia best prediction of the age of onset [ 12 ]. the authors of a ( sara ) and of mri volume markers [ 14, 22 ]. other lonmeta - analysis of genetic risk factors for modulation of gitudinal studies in sca1, sca2, sca3, and sca7 with age at onset in sca3 reported earlier age of onset in non - follow - up periods of 1. 0 to 2. 7 years did not find increases portuguese europeans than in portuguese / south brazilians of nfl blood concentrations [ 28, 29, 33 ]. there are only with similar cag repeat lengths underlining the importance limited data related to the prognostic value of nfl. in sca1 of population - specific factors [ 13 ]. in sca27b, which is mutation carriers, time to conversion to manifest ataxia was caused by an intronic gaa repeat expansion of the fgf14 shorter in individuals with high nfl serum concentrations gene, the relationship between repeat length and age of [ 28 ]. in sca2, higher nfl concentrations predicted cerebelonset has not yet been finally established [ 5 ]. lar volume loss [ 29 ]. in contrast, nfl was not identified as a 1 3 104 page 4 of 11 the cerebellum ( 2025 ) 24 : 104 predictor of ataxia progression in sca1 and sca3 [ 14, 22 ]. imaging biomarkers an overview of nfl studies in scas is
