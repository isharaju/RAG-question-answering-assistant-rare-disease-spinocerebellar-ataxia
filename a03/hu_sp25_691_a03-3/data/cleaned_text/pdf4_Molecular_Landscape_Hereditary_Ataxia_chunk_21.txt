a deleterious variant ( 46. 2 % ) and 7 of them were performed a systematic review analyzing 33 primary studreported to be symptomatic when genetic testing was ies on ngs in ataxic patients assessing a median diagnostic performed. yield of 47. 5 % ( tenorio et al. 2023 ). indeed, the vast majority of collected studies assessed repeat expansions as a first diagnostic step prior to ngs ( n = 28 / 33 ). thus, more than discussion 50 % of ha cases remain unresolved. this gap is problematic because identification of the underlying genetic cause hereditary ataxias represent a diagnostic challenge due to of ha provides patients with an etiological diagnosis of their diverse phenotypes and genetic etiologies, which can their disease, facilitating prognostic trajectories, prenatal / manifest at any age and exhibit various modes of inheritance preimplantation diagnosis and allowing early diagnosis of patterns ( tenorio et al. 2023 ). hundreds of genes have been relatives ( beijer et al. 2024 ). associated to ha with heterogeneous pathomechanisms, in this report, we performed a two - tiered analysis based including tandem repeat expansions, svs or snvs in both on repeat expansion assessments and exome sequencing on a nuclear and mitochondrial dna ( sandford and burmeister cohort of 70 patient with undiagnosed familial and sporadic 2014 ). ataxia. overall, we identified pathogenic / likely pathogenic variants in 40 % ( n = 28 / 70 ) and vus in 20 % ( n = 14 / 70 ) of 1 3 554 human genetics ( 2025 ) 144 : 545 â€“ 557 cases. there was no significance in terms of the number of the initial description of aaggg expansions at this locus, positive tests between familial and sporadic cases ( n = 11 / 20 several further pathogenic repeat expansion conformations vs. 17 / 44, p = 0. 28 ). these data diverge from the previously - have been described, i. e., acagg, aaggc, agggc, and published literature where a molecular diagnosis was more agagg with slightly different frequencies upon ethniclikely in those with a family history ( bogdanova - mihaylova ity ( maltby et al. 2024 ). furthermore, more recently, gaa et al. 2021 ). this could
